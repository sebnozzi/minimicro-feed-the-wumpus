This is simple catch-the-falling-object (in this case a delicious muffin) game for the [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/index.html) virtual computer.

In this game you play the nice monster Wumpus, who tries to eat as many muffins as possible in the given time. He might miss one from time to time. It's OK.
